## Network Ninja is a serious game developed for EG-Cert (Egyptian Computer Emergency Readiness Team) with the primary objective of raising awareness about crucial aspects of cyber security.


Network Ninja is an exciting action hack-and-slash game designed to engage players while raising awareness about password security. It combines thrilling gameplay with valuable educational content to ensure players stay captivated while learning important cybersecurity principles. 


**My Roles in the Project:**
- Programming Team Lead: Oversaw programming aspects and promoted effective collaboration within the team.
- Code Architecture: Designed a solid foundation for the game's codebase, enabling seamless interaction and communication among scripts and components.
- Deisnged and scripted the main Character behaviors: movement behavior, camera behavior, damage behavior, animations behavior, ultimate mode behavior, and everything related to the main character in the game.


**Features:**

- Password security awareness: A strong emphasis is placed on raising awareness among players regarding the creation of robust passwords, the avoidance of password sharing, and the risks associated with using the same password across multiple sites. These crucial aspects have been implemented as core features in the game.

- Diverse player abilities and Ultimate mode: Players are provided with a range of skills that can be utilized to navigate the game world effectively. Furthermore, Ultimate mode, characterized by slow motion, can be activated as the ultimate gauge is filled, offering players an exhilarating experience.

- Fluid movement mechanics: Basic movement mechanics, such as jumping and dashing, have been incorporated into the game, allowing for seamless and agile traversal through the immersive environments. (jump has been implemented for future plans, it doesn't have any use in this version).

- Varied adversaries: A wide array of opponents, including normal enemies, mini bosses, and formidable boss characters. (more enemies may be implemented in the future).
